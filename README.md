# Text Classification using Naive Bayes Classifier

This repository demonstrates text classification using a multi-nomial Naive Bayes Classifier. The IMDB dataset is used for this experiment.

## Features

At the end of the experiment, one will be able to:

- Perform different text processing techniques such as:
  - Removing HTML strips and noisy text
  - Removing special characters
  - Lemmatization
  - Stemming
  - Tokenization
  - Removing stop words
- Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes model from the scikit-learn machine learning library to predict the sentiment ('positive' or 'negative') for a movie reviews dataset
- Implement Gradio directly within a Google Colab notebook to generate a customizable UI for displaying the predictions

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `Text_Classification_using_NaiveBayes.ipynb` in Google Colab.

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the text processing techniques, train and evaluate the Naive Bayes model.

3. Implement Gradio directly within the notebook to generate a UI for prediction. This allows you to input your own movie review text for sentiment prediction directly within the notebook environment.
